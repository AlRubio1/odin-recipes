        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Traditional Mexican beef tacos are made with marinated sliced or shredded beef on soft corn tortillas.  Those are great!  But, that’s not what most Americans think of when we think of classic tacos.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chili powder</li>
            <li>Cumin</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Mexican oregano</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the ground beef in a skillet with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Brown the beef with olive oil and then drain any fat.
            </li>
            <li>Add the spices along with the tomato paste and water (or tomato sauce)
            </li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer and then cook for a few more minutes until the sauce thickens.
            </li>
            <li>Be careful not to dry out the taco meat when you add the sauce. Once the beef is cooked, you want to cook it with the seasoning and liquid on medium low and just until the sauce starts to thicken. Keep an eye on it so it doesn’t dry out.
            </li>
            <li>Heat up the tortillas before adding the ground beef on top. You can heat them up in the microwave, oven or on a skillet for 1-2 minutes per side. This makes the tortillas soft, pliable and much less likely to break.
            </li>
            <li>Add onions to the mixture to make it more savory. You’ll want to cook the onions until they soften before adding the ground beef. It gives the taco meat a deeper flavor, but it’s totally optional. Adding onion powder is a quick easy update as well.
                
            </li>

        </ol>
